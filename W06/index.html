  <h1>Week 06 Notes</h1>
  <h3>Meeting with Brother Blazzard</h3>
  <p>In my meeting with Brother Blazzard we talked about the app that I made and about the struggles I had. He said that he was glad I had this experience of needing to go back to a previous commit as that is a great learning expereince. That made me feel a lot more confident in my programming skills. He also said that I am right on track with the things that I was trying to do with implementing my own code and getting the new features to work. This also made me very grateful and feel like I am doing better than I feel I am at times. </p>

  <h3>Notes on ToDo App and what happed as I did this project</h3>
  <p>During my build of the ToDo app I learned a lot of things. I was able to follow the guide that we were allowed to follow in order to get it done. I got it completed and looking the way that I wanted it to. After that I then started adding my own parts to the app. The main thing that I wanted to get working was instead of having the app delete the list item when a user clicked on the check box, I wanted to have the program just mark it as complete and then remove it from the currently active list items. With every item that is created in the app I have it create the checkbox, the name value and also a button, then set inside that button an <b>X</b> made with an SVG element. I wanted to have this act as the delete button. When a user clicked on the <b>X</b> button I wanted to do basically the same thing that it did when you would click on the checkbox, remove it from the list and from the local storage data. After about 2 hours of working on this somewhere in my code it broke. It ended up to where you could use the app, add items in remove them. The problem came when you wanted to reload the page. The local storage was still there but, it would not populate the list correctly, it would create the correct number of list items but they only contained a checkbox, not the name value or the <b>X</b> button. I spent another hour or so trying to fix this and just get it working like it did before and I couldn’t get it working. Ultimately, I had to revert back to my previous commit to GitHub, which was the initial finished app without any of my code. I was able to salvage some of the code that I was working on but I don’t have any of this working right now. I am hoping to have enough time at some point this semester to get this working the way that I want it to, but for now I am grateful for the things I have learned from making this app.  </p>
