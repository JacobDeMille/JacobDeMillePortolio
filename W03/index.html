    <h1>Week 2 Reading Notes</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 5: Objects</h2>
    <h4>Object Declaration</h4>
    <p>Objects are very similar to objects used in other OOP languages, they are much easier to use in JavaScript though
        becuase they can be definded without the need of createing a class first. The easiest and recommended way to
        declare an object is using the object literal notation </p>

    <pre><code>const spiderman = {
    name: "Spiderman", 
    realName: "Peter Parker"
};</code></pre>

    <p>The parts that are in the object are called <b>properties</b>, and if a property is a function it is known as a
        method.</p>

    <pre><code>const superman = {
    fly() {
        return 'Up, up and away!'; 
    } 
};</code></pre>

        <p></p>
