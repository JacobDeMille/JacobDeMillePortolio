    <h1>Week 2 Reading Notes</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 5: Objects</h2>
    <h4>Object Declaration</h4>
    <p>Objects are very similar to objects used in other OOP languages, they are much easier to use in JavaScript though
        becuase they can be definded without the need of createing a class first. The easiest and recommended way to
        declare an object is using the object literal notation </p>

    <pre>
<code>const spiderman = {
    name: 'Spiderman',
    'real name': 'Peter Parker',
    height: 178,
    weight: 76,
    hero: true,
    villain: false,
    allies: ['IronMan','Captain America', 'The Falcon'],
    swing() {
        return 'Thwip, Thwip!';
    },
    catchPhrase: "Your friendly neighboorhood Spiderman!"
};</code>
</pre>

    <p>The parts that are in the object are called <b>properties</b>, and if a property is a function it is known as a
        method.</p>

    <pre><code>const superman = {
    fly() {
        return 'Up, up and away!'; 
    } 
};</code></pre>

        <p>There are several ways to find the properties of an Object. You can use a for loop to log them in the console, and with ES2017 you can 
            use the Object.keys() method to get just the keys or you can use the Object.values to get just the values.
        </p>
        <pre>
<code>  //log for just the keys of spiderman
for(const value of Object.key(spiderman)) {
    console.log(key);
}
    // log for just the values of spiderman
for(const value of Object.values(spiderman)) {
    console.log(value);
}
    // log for entries, or the key value pairs
for(const [key,value] of Object.entries(spiderman)) {
    console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
}
    // Opn console log to see these for loops output</code>
        </pre>
        
        <h3>Objects as Parameters</h3>
        <p>Objects can be used as parameteres for functions, this allows the arguments to be provided by and in any order.</p>
        <pre>
<code>function hello({name, catchPhrase}) {
    console.log(`Hi! My name is ${name} and I'm ${catchPhrase}`);
}
hello({catchPhrase: spiderman['catchPhrase'], name: spiderman['real name']});
        </pre>

        <h3>JSON</h3>
        <p>JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, it is a very popular data-storage format. One thing that I think is awesome
            about JSON is that it can be used by not just JavaScript but a lot of other programming languages as well. 
        </p>
        <pre>
<code>const laptop = '{"brand": "Lenovo", "model": "Legion", '
    "series": "7i", "type": "Gaming", "specs": {"cpu": "Intel i7", 
    "gpu": "Nvidia RTX 2060"}}'</code>
        </pre>
        <p>This object in it's current form is not yet a JSON, to convert it to a JSON you need to parse the string</p>
        <pre>
<code>JSON.parse(laptop);</code>
        </pre>
        <p>You can also turn a JSON back into a string object by using the stringify() method</p>
        <pre>
<code>JSON.stringify(laptop);</code>
        </pre>
        <h3>Math and Date</h3>
        <p>There are functions built into the Math Object and the Date Object. One thing that is new to me is that there are getters and setters 
            associated with the Date Object. Getters and setters are very handy to and good to know for the future.
        </p>
        <h3>RegExp</h3>
        <p>Regular expression, or <em>RegExp</em> for short, is a patter that is used to search strings for matches to the pattern.</p>
        <pre>
<code>  // First mothod to great a regular expression
const pattern = /[a-zA-Z]+ing$/;
    // Second method to create a regular expression 
    // using the <em>new</em> operator
const pattern = new RegExp('[a-zA-Z]+ing');</code>
        </pre>

        <h2>Chapter 6: The DOM</h2>
        <p>The DOM stands for <b>"The Document Object Model"</b> and it allows you to access a web page and enable 
            interations with the page. The DOM is a collection of nodes that form a tree-like structure.
            Everything on the wepage is treated as a node by the DOM. Everything in the document is a child of the 
            root node, the HTML tag. The DOM is <em>Language agnostic</em> so it may be used in any programming language. </p>
            <h4>Getting Elelments</h4>
            <p>To get an element from the document you use the <em>documnt</em> key word. You can use this with diferent getters to 
                get specific elements, such as <b>getElementById(), getElementsByClassName(), getElementByTagName(), querySelector(), and querySelectorAll()</b></p>
            <p>ID: Each Id selector should be unique to just one element. getElementById() is the most commonly used method of accessing elements on a web page.</p>
            <p>Query Selectors: querySelector() method allows you to use CSS notation in order to find the 
                <em>first</em> element that matches a CSS selector. querySelectorAll() will return a node list
                of <em>all</em> the elements that mat the CSS selector. 
            </p>
        <h2>Chapter 7: Events</h2>
        <p>Inline event handles are not the recommended way to add event listeners, the JavaScript code is mixed up with the HTML, only one handler can be added for each event-type,
            the code for the handler is hidden away form the markup, the JavaScript code has to be entered as a string. 
            It is recommened to use event listeners to take care of these issues. 
        </p>
        <h3>Question<h5>As I have been going through this reading I have had a question come to my mind over and over again, Why are there still those that need to support older versions of 
            Internet Explorer? Is this for companies or sites that are used a lot in other countries, like 3rd world countries, where they don't have the new computers and have to rely
            on old hardware and software? 
        </h5></h3>
