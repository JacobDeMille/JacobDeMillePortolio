    <h1>Week 2 Reading Notes</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 5: Objects</h2>
    <h4>Object Declaration</h4>
    <p>Objects are very similar to objects used in other OOP languages, they are much easier to use in JavaScript though
        becuase they can be definded without the need of createing a class first. The easiest and recommended way to
        declare an object is using the object literal notation </p>

    <pre>
<code>const spiderman = {
    name: 'Spiderman',
    'real name': 'Peter Parker',
    height: 178,
    weight: 76,
    hero: true,
    villain: false,
    allies: ['IronMan','Captain America', 'The Falcon'],
    swing() {
        return 'Thwip, Thwip!';
    },
    catchPhrase: "Your friendly neighboorhood Spiderman!"
};</code>
</pre>

    <p>The parts that are in the object are called <b>properties</b>, and if a property is a function it is known as a
        method.</p>

    <pre><code>const superman = {
    fly() {
        return 'Up, up and away!'; 
    } 
};</code></pre>

        <p>There are several ways to find the properties of an Object. You can use a for loop to log them in the console, and with ES2017 you can 
            use the Object.keys() method to get just the keys or you can use the Object.values to get just the values.
        </p>
        <pre>
<code>  //log for just the keys of spiderman
for(const value of Object.key(spiderman)) {
    console.log(key);
}
    // log for just the values of spiderman
for(const value of Object.values(spiderman)) {
    console.log(value);
}
    // log for entries, or the key value pairs
for(const [key,value] of Object.entries(spiderman)) {
    console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
}
    // Opn console log to see these for loops output</code>
        </pre>
        
        <h3>Objects as Parameters</h3>
        <p>Objects can be used as parameteres for functions, this allows the arguments to be provided by and in any order.</p>
        <pre>
<code>function hello({name, catchPhrase}) {
    console.log(`Hi! My name is ${name} and I'm ${catchPhrase}`);
}
hello({catchPhrase: spiderman['catchPhrase'], name: spiderman['real name']});
        </pre>

        <h3>JSON</h3>
        <p>JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, it is a very popular data-storage format. One thing that I think is awesome
            about JSON is that it can be used by not just JavaScript but a lot of other programming languages as well. 
        </p>
        <pre>
<code>const laptop = '{"brand": "Lenovo", "model": "Legion", '
    "series": "7i", "type": "Gaming", "specs": {"cpu": "Intel i7", 
    "gpu": "Nvidia RTX 2060"}}'</code>
        </pre>
        <p>This object in it's current form is not yet a JSON, to convert it to a JSON you need to parse the string</p>
        <pre>
<code>JSON.parse(laptop);</code>
        </pre>
        <p>You can also turn a JSON back into a string object by using the stringify() method</p>
        <pre>
<code>JSON.stringify(laptop);</code>
        </pre>
        <h3>Math and Date</h3>
        <p>There are functions built into the Math Object and the Date Object. One thing that is new to me is that there are getters and setters 
            associated with the Date Object. Getters and setters are very handy to and good to know for the future.
        </p>
        <h3>RegExp</h3>
        <p>Regular expression, or <em>RegExp</em> for short, is a patter that is used to search strings for matches to the pattern.</p>

    <script>
        const spiderman = {
            name: 'Spiderman',
            'real name': 'Peter Parker',
            height: 178,
            weight: 76,
            hero: true,
            villain: false,
            allies: ['IronMan','Captain America', 'The Falcon'],
            swing() {
                return 'Thwip, Thwip!';
            },
            catchPhrase: "Your friendly neighboorhood Spiderman!"
        };

        for(const key in spiderman) {
            if(spiderman.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
                console.log(key+":"+spiderman[key]);
            }
        }
        // log for just the values of superman
        for(const value of Object.values(spiderman)) {
            console.log(value);
        }
        // log for entries, or the key value pairs, in the superman object
        for(const [key,value] of Object.entries(spiderman)) {
            console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
        }
        function hello({name, catchPhrase}) {
            console.log(`Hi! My name is ${name} and I'm ${catchPhrase}`);
        }
        hello({catchPhrase: spiderman['catchPhrase'], name: spiderman['real name']});

        const laptop = '{"brand": "Lenovo", "model": "Legion", "series": "7i", "type": "Gaming", "specs": {"cpu": "Intel i7", "gpu": "Nvidia RTX 2060"}}'
        JSON.parse(laptop);
        console.log(laptop);
