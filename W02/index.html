    <h1>Week 2 Reading Notes</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <h3>Variables</h3>
    <p>Though var is used in old examples of code, using const and let are the new standard. We should try and use const
        as much as possible as this will help to avoid problems down the road.</p>
    <p>const and let both have 'block scope' so they only exist inside blocks they are declared in."variables defined
        inside a block using the let or const will only be available inside that block"</p>
    <p>Using global scope is not considered to be good practice.</p>
    <h3>Naming</h3>
    <p>When naming constants and Variables you should be as sensible as you can, naming a variable something 'tablet',
        'mouse', or 'bottle' is better than naming something 'x', or 'y' or '123'</p><br>
        <h4>Examples of Valid names</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>$name</li>
        <li>_answer</li>
        <li>firstName</li>
        <li>last_name</li>
        <li>address_line1</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <p>To create <b>Arrays</b> you can use either array literals <em>"ex: const myArray = [];"</em> or the array constructor function <em>"ex: const myArrya = new Array();"</em>. It is preferable to use array literls over array constructor to use less typing. </p>
    <p><b>Maps</b> are a type of list with key value pairs, similar to 'dictionaries' in other programming languages. Maps can use any data type as a key. At this time there is no literal way to creat a map, <em>"ex: const romanNumerals = new Map();"</em></p>
    <b><p>This symbol ( => ) is known as a 'hash rocket'.</p></b>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <p>There are several different ways to declare a function, it is not recommended to declare functions using the constructor method as this can cause unexpected errors. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Function() Declaration</h4>
               <p>function hello(){
                console.log('Hello World!');
            }</p>
        </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Function() Expression</h4>
                <p>const goodbye = function(){
                console.log('Goodbye World!');
            };</p>
        </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Function() Constructor</h4>
                <p>const hi = new Function('console.log("Hi World!");');</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        
    </p>
    <p>In ES6 there is a new way to declare a function, it is called the <em>arrow</em> syntax, the arrow symbol is also know as a <b>'hash rocket'</b><br><em><b>"ex: const square = x => x*x;"</b></em></p>
    <p>
        <h3>Advantages of Arrow Functions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>They are much less verbose than normal function declarations.</li>
            <li>Single parameters don't need putting into parentheses.</li>
            <li>The body of the function doesn't need placing inside a block if it's only one line.</li>
            <li>The return keyword isn't required if the return statement is the only statement in the body of the function.</li>
            <li>They don't bind their own value of this to the function (we'll see why this is a particularly useful property when we cover objects later in the book).</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
