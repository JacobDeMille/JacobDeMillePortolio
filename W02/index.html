    <h1>Week 2 Reading Notes</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <h3>Variables</h3>
    <p>Though var is used in old examples of code, using const and let are the new standard. We should try and use const
        as much as possible as this will help to avoid problems down the road.</p>
    <p>const and let both have 'block scope' so they only exist inside blocks they are declared in."variables defined
        inside a block using the let or const will only be available inside that block"</p>
    <p>Using global scope is not considered to be good practice.</p>
    <h3>Naming</h3>
    <p>When naming constants and Variables you should be as sensible as you can, naming a variable something 'tablet',
        'mouse', or 'bottle' is better than naming something 'x', or 'y' or '123'</p><br>
        <h4>Examples of Valid names</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>$name</li>
        <li>_answer</li>
        <li>firstName</li>
        <li>last_name</li>
        <li>address_line1</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <p>To create <b>Arrays</b> you can use either array literals <em>"ex: const myArray = [];"</em> or the array constructor function <em>"ex: const myArrya = new Array();"</em>. It is preferable to use array literls over array constructor to use less typing. </p>
    <p><b>Maps</b> are a type of list with key value pairs, similar to 'dictionaries' in other programming languages. Maps can use any data type as a key. At this time there is no literal way to creat a map, <em>"ex: const romanNumerals = new Map();"</em></p>
    <b><p>This symbol ( => ) is known as a 'hash rocket'.</p></b>
