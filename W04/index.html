    <h1>Week 4 Reading Notes</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 8: Forms</h2>
    <h4>A simple serch box and button using a form</h4>
    <form name='search' action='/search'>
        <input name='searchInput'>
        <button type='submit'>Search</button>
    </form>
    <p>There are many different events that come along with forms, one is the focus event and the blur event. Focus will be activated when the user focuses on the element. The blur event is the exact opposite, when the user moves away from the focus area the blur event is activiated.</p>
    <h3>Submitting a form</h3>
    <p>The submit button is used to submit forms. By using events you can do things like prevent the submission of a form before. This is helpful for validation purposes, you can prevent the form from submitting and then run some functions to check if all of the form fields have been filled out or not. Once everything has been properly filled out, you can then allow the form to be submitted.</p>
    <h3>New Attributes in HTML5</h3>
    <p>In HTML there were new attributes introduced for the <em>input</em> element. <br> Autofocus, gives focus to this element when a page loads. <br>
        Placeholder, will insert the value provided in the input field until the user enters some text <br>
        Maxlength, will limit the number of characters that can be entered in the field.</p>
        <h2>Chapter 12: OOP</h2>
        <p>In order to practice Object Oriented Progaming using JavaScript, in a little more practical way, I decided to work more on my Dice Roller application. I dicided that I wanted to find a way to make it work using the same kind consept that Wes Bos used in his drumkit application from JavaScript30. It took me some time but I have now re-worked the JavaScript for the Dice Roller to use keydown functions and use OOP. In the application I set up a class function similar that in our reading, <pre>
<code>// Class declaration for Dice object
class Dice {
    constructor(sides) {
    this.sides = sides;
    }
    roll() {
        const diceRoll = Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1);
        console.log(diceRoll);
        return diceRoll;
    }
}</code>
        </pre> Using this I was then able to create 7 objects for the different dice. <code>ex: const dice_four = new Dice(4);</code> Then adding an EventListener to the window for when a key is pressed down, I then call a function called rollDice that gets the value of the buttons in the HTML, and checked to see which key was pressed. It then run through a <code>swtich</code> block and then calls the object it is associated with, and sets the output <code>dive</code> to the returned number. My next goal is to be get it to work with clicking on one of the buttons and making a little animation showing that the key was pressed or button was clicked on. I also want to work on getting the code as efficient as possible, maybe by finding something else to use rather than a switch statement.</p>
